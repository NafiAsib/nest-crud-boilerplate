## Commit

[commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) is used to adhere to a proper commit convention. You can manually write commit messages by ahering to the rules of the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. Or you may use [commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) to interactively generate commit messages.

To use commitizen, run `pnpm commit` and follow the prompts.
